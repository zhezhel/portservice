# TODO

1. Count errors in state to avoid dead-loops (limit to 3 errors with the same offset) + alerts
2. Extract decoder to interface (in usecases imports should be only from core, and go std.)
3. Add more unit tests, e2e tests
4. Add metrics: operations, mem usage, transaction duration
5. Add logging
